## Opening
Welcome to the Material Plane. This world has seen it’s fair share of heroes and adventurers, but now the world is in a time of unprecedented peace.

This story however, is not one of heroes, nor is it one of villains. 

This story, is just that. A story. 

and that is how the people of this world have lived for a few ¿thousand years at this point? they got comfortable. and the peak of that... *arrogant* comfort, is [[the Great Dreams Casino]] of [[Avaria]], a smaller high-roller's club for the particularly wealthy, which also happens to be where we start our journey. it's the middle of [[The Material Plane]]'s winter, two days before [[the day of beacons]] (which is like a festival thingy), and a week before a district's election, the very district that the casino is in. as a result, there are some very, very powerful people in the casino as I speak, along with the staff and you seven, of course. 

Somebody will die tonight, maybe a few people. each of you is here for a target, and each of you have your own reasons. keep your reasons to yourself but please, let everyone else know the rest.

## Asphodael's Breakdown
After MILLENIA, THAT’S all you have to say? You’re SORRY? You lock me away, in the home we made for the BOTH of us, you turned it into a prison, all over these miserable fucking things? They are barely aware half the time, and when they are, they can't even tell when they are being used! I’ve been fucking with that one’s life (pointing at Ivan) since they were BORN, I've been in their mind for MONTHS, but I don't think they’ve even once considered that I was just using them to get free! And its not just that one, I’ve done the same. Exact. Thing. To millions of humans since the end of the second age!

if I must die tonight it will be on my own two feet, not grovelling on the floor like a fucking animal
