### modified "Do not go gentle into that good night"
Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
  
Though twisted men at their end know dark is right,  
Because their words through forked tongues held no weight they  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
  
Good men who caught and sang the sun in flight,  
And learn, too late, their wings would burn away,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
  
wild things, near death, who see with blinding sight  
Blind eyes should blaze like meteors and be fey,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
  
And you, _stardust_, there in fake heights,  
Curse me, bless me, with your fierce tears, I pray.  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
Rage, **_rage_** against the dying of the light.

### beginnings
you awake alone, 
no ship nor crew, 
and early as it is, you are accident-prone. 

you start to pull from the waters, 
old trinkets riddled with dust,
but you are unhappy with what it offers. 

but keep pulling, keep working,
and the things shed their dust,
it seems you've found something worth hoarding. 

you find a friend, nearly as young as you,
although they seem to know more,
and even more, they accrue.

but as friends turn to much more,
then again far less,
keeping them around begins to feel like a chore.

### Plakos
among the waves, a hidden home,
built for two, but one's alone.
cant outrun,
cant evade,
and so it's time to burn.
### Time immemorial
ongoing conflict
not yours to start, 
nor yours to finish
but sooner or later
this too shall pass

so called heroes
so called villains
ages passed
and ages to come
this too shall pass

but the inevitable things come and go as they choose
and in the end you will always lose
and this too shall pass

so sit back, relax, as the waves wash away
the pain
the fear
the regret
the loss
and become one with them, 
for from them you were made and to them you will return

### Time again
Back and forth and back again
counting down from 6 to 7
one step forward and you find yourself where you began
how many times until things go right?
until things go the way *they* want?

that prophet of yours seems to have something to say
that voice in your head, 
that hand drenched in a friend's blood
that sense of déjà vu of dread

the clock grows tired of its ticking
round and round and round 
back and forth and back again
