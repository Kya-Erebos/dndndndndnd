## 1 - [[Ivan Riggs Clockwork|Ivan]] - The Book
It was a dark night. In his dream, Ivan was surrounded by the castle that looms over his village

He paces around the creaking halls and shivers at every gust of wind kissing his ear. The floor falls in and the mouth of the castle drowns him in horror

A warm hand caresses his face, showing him it’s okay.

Ivan: Who are you? 
Asphodael: I'm afraid telling you that would lead to a rather untimely demise for you, and i still have need of you for now 
I: Are you going to kill me? 
A: Not if you can promise me something, and to keep hidden.
A go kissy kissy :3 
A: Find the dusty old book where we stand now, hand it off to them once you have it. 
I: Why? What's in that book? 
A: Ask not now, love. Secrets lie awake for you to see. with a mind like yours, I'll be back soon.
I: No… Wait… Who are you? NO! PLEASE! Please don’t go!!
Ivan wakes up (Hard)

## 2 - [[Sloth]] - The Star

Another dream. the same kind you've been having for months now, since you officially became a member and took all the rites. 

but this one feels different. you aren't usually aware you're dreaming, are you?
and you're usually in control over yourself.

the world around you is dark. impossibly dark. you must be outside, as the stars are on display, some shooting across the night sky. 

it's a beautiful night. 

a star falls from the sky. it floats down in front of you, it's fairly small, just small enough to fit into the palm of your hands if you were to reach out and grab it. 

and you do. 

it hurts your hands, both from the heat and the dozens of points jutting out from it's centre, but you hold it there for a moment, looking at it. 

and then

you take a bite

and the sky shatters, red seeping out at the cracks

you take another bite
and another
and another

until the sky is gone
and in it's place

are five eyes, backdropped by the red glow, looking down at you. 

## 3 - [[Grunklespurt]] - The Reminder
it's dark. darker than should really be possible. still, you can see, if only a little. 
you're in some basement, but the ceiling above you is ruined and you can see the sky beyond it. 

weirdly, there's streaks of red across the sky, spider-webbed like a shattered mirror. 

you hear a noise in the room, your eyes dart down to the source of it. 
crying. they're crying. 
they feel familiar, but you don't quite recognise them in the dark. 

they're crying. 
your face feels wet, you put your hands up to your face and find that you are also crying.  

they're crying. 
you're crying. 
your hands are wet. whatever's on them is warm. you put you thumb and pointer finger together to test the substance and find it to be a bit tacky under the surface. 

the person in front of you turns to face you. you can't make out their face but you know his name.
you know it.

you know it,
you know it,
you

forgot. his. name. 

the sky changes. the cracks you saw grow, the ground beneath you shaking as it happens. 

there it is. His name. 

you call out to gregert, his name burning in your mouth, branding it with the pain you felt the last time you saw him. But you're too late.

you wake up. 

## 4 - [[Mhurren]] - The horde
the sky is dark. the area you're in looks like Xeron's office, but only by the arrangement of the furniture ahead of you. there are no walls closing this place in, nor a ceiling to hide you from the stars. 

"take a seat" it's Xeron. their voice is off, a bit too cold for them. 

a chair flies out from the darkness behind you, your legs giving out beneath you and forcing you into it. 

"how long have you known?" you can see them now, standing with their back to you. 
you try to speak, but nothing comes out. your mouth feels like it's been sewn shut

it repeats, putting emphasis on each word individually. "how. long. have. you. known." they're turning to face you. something, some fluid, is rising from the ground. it's almost watery, but it sticks to whings too well, almost like a slime. 

Xeron is yelling now. how long have you known? known what? about the guild? about them? about-

your next thought is cut off by a bird calling. looking up, you see a raven. and another. and another. and another. and...

there's thousands up there. the fluid is rising. it's almost warm, almost cold, almost so hot it burns, all at once everywhere it touches you. it's almost up to your knees now. it's as dark as the sky is. 

one raven flies down, holding something red and silver in it's beak. you can't make out it's shape. Xeron takes it from the bird, staring at it for a moment. 

"you are dismissed."

the sky changes, streaks of red appearing like cracks along a mirror. far away, you see what looks like the source of the cracks. you hear some low rumbles, as if there was an earthquake in that direction.

the fluid rises. it looks like it's grabbing at the furniture, and you can roughly make out claws and eyes and

you wake up.
