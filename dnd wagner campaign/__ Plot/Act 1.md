# Overview:

main goals:
- learn of the [[Church of the Blind Eye]]
	- possibly bring [[Asphodael]] into the picture, but NOT directly
- call [[Sloth]]'s origins into question

where to level up:
- Squink! straight up saying "yeah you guys level up now"
- first time leaving any of the Church's locations (unless they've recently levelled up)
# [[encounter of the Great Dreams Casino]]:
- [[Equinox]] hinting at [[Asphodael]]'s influence. 
- [[Pin]] begging for their life if found out
- Pin joining the party, either as themselves or as another NPC
### where next? (and what happens?)
with the information provided to the players, there are three places they'll likely go
1. To World's gate (staying)
	- following Equinox, likely more for information than anything (have them say "dont follow me" or something)
	- possibly introduce [[Squink!]]
2. To World's gate, and then the Underdark.
	- have Mhurren get recognized when they get there
	- possibly introduce [[Squink!]]
3. Staying in [[Avaria]], for the festival
	- Vex gets voted in for the district if they live
	- regardless of the fate of [[Vex fynx]], during the festival the encounter will be addressed, and, depending on if he lives or not, Vex will address the party directly (and they become criminals!!!)
		- Vex has an ulterior motive, plans on enlisting the party. uses their status as criminals to gain leverage.  
1. to [[The Hordes]], investigating the source of the Rot
