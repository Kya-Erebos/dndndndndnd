"retcons" done by [[__Worldbuilding/_3 NPCs/Anima/the Drift|the Drift]], generally to halt the party's progress to [[Asphodael]], but also so i can retcon things in a way that has lore reasons :3

memories *can* be kept through these breaks, though they generally aren't. 

[[Asphodael]] specifically is immune to losing memories through time breaks
