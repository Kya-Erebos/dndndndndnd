## Lore
Stereotypical fighter class personality with mild hints of barbarian personality. Hes wery extroverted, headstrong, and efficient. When party rests or is in preparation for something they reveal top notch household/housework skills overtime, slowly (cooking, cleaning, Medicare, ect.) Reasoning for this being their dwarven colony prides and prioritizes in caretaking and protection of family. Ferox wa known to have formerly been engaged with Nurale Bronzeguard who left him after subtle manipulation into marriage with Elyrseas Wyvernfroth who would then abuse and kill her. Ferox feels responsible for their death and therefore fears intimacy and has severe attachment+abandonment issues; his colony, and especially his and his ex fiancée's family blame him for being unable to protect Nurale and he was banished while Elyrseas fled. This crushing pressure leads to immense anxiety and depression guided by the thought of loosing anyone else in the same ways he's lost everyone from his former life which is why he struggles so immensely with establishing and maintaining new relationships. Knowing about how his fiancée was manipulated, he seeks revenge on Elyrseas but struggles to find him anywhere; nonetheless he swears to kill him for the murder and theft of his love, Nurale. Due to his dedication to this goal, in spite of how reckless some of his actions may come off as, they're all made with excessive caution and immense care and purpose to work towards his end goal of slaying his main rival. An effect of being blamed and exiled for not being good enough for Nurale according to his former colony, especially after her death he was unable to prevent, he constantly strives to improve and hone his basic household skills and ability to protect out of fear he isn't and will never be good enough, sometimes to a fault ending in intense strain mentally and physically. He's constantly plagued by the thought that if he improves enough maybe one day he'll deserve to be loved and maybe if he'd been better beforehand that he'd never have lost Nurale. His trauma as a taste would be chocolatey, nutty, and crunchy for a base but with hints of lavender and rose. His main ideals are competence, loyalty, and family/friends.
