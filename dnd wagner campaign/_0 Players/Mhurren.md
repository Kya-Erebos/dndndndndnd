## Lore
Mhurren is a half-orc monk, left on the property of a [[Worlds Gate Purist Monastery|monastery]] to protect them from a natural disaster. They had trained in martial arts and usage of the Ki since they could walk.

They had to run from said monastery after being found out for being LGBTQ+ (bisexual and genderqueer), such a thing being considered sinful in the eyes of that religion. They were banished with an order to never return to or near the monastery.

They spent several years camping in a forest until they met a sentient raven, Ambrosius. Mhurren and Ambrosius travelled for years before meeting with the rest of the party.
