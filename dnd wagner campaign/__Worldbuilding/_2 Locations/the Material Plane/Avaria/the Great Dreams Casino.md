the starting location for the campaign. The peak of arrogance and greed in [[Starcrest]], and a safe haven for those who benefit from it. 

at the start of the campaign, a few key figures are here:
- [[Benjamin Knightly]], Halfling - a shady businessman previously from a wealthy family. was since disowned due to "soiling their good name", but still manages to do just that. a member of [[The General Ability Examiners]], has *some* ties to the [[Church of the Blind Eye]], but is unaware of their real "identity"(?)
- [[Equinox]], unknown race - a powerful magic user. has far too much blood on their hands, bounty hunter or not. is currently in a meeting with the next target, likely discussing protection for tonight
- [[Vex fynx]], Human - a political figure up for reelection. has some questionable beliefs, particularly around other realms and realm travel.
- [[Mar√ßial Ximon]], warforged - a brilliant inventor, also here to meet Vex. motives are unknown, but she has been around the World Tear at Worlds Gate
- [[Pin]], changeling - an escapee from the feywild. difficult to place, but they are guaranteed to be here tonight. there is a large, LARGE bounty on their head
- [[Elyrseas Wyvernfroth]], dwarf - charismatic, controlling, murderous. though, unless you're here to kill him, you wouldnt know
- [[Kinteppa]], satyr - many, many connections to various cults and crime organisations. while not the top of the chain of command, they are an integral part of many operations.
