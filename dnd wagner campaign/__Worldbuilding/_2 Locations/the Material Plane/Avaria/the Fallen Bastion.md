This location did not exist in its current state prior to [[Time Break 0]]. previous state unknown

An old military base, which was destroyed when [[the Rot]] first made its way into Avaria. 

it was a tragedy. there was no hope in stopping the initial attack, they were caught off-guard. later on they managed to push back the rot, all the way out of Avaria, but this was years after the siege. 

everyone who was present at the time of the siege was killed.
