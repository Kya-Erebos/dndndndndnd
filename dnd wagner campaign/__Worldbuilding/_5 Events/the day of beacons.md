the lighting of the beacons is a ceremony celebrated across all large cities in [[The Material Plane]]. this also has a festival attached to it, and plenty of little celebrations pop up all over the realm, with the best lightshows occurring in [[Avaria]]. 

the one occurring just after the start of the campaign will have a speech done by either [[Vex fynx]] or [[Mar√ßial Ximon]], depending on which one was killed in the starting encounter
