Outlast, a city in [[The Underdark]], is a safe haven for various non-violent criminals and a quick journey to [[Bloodbath]] for the ones who have committed violent offences. I mean that in a very literal way, there is a custom-made hole to that leads directly to bloodbath made by [[Kaff]] and [[Phi]], who are also the patrons of the city.
