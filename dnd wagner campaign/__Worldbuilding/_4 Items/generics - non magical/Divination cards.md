these guys act as tarot cards for the world. they each have four meanings based on their orientation relative to the reader. 

Divination cards are tricky things to work with. There are four meanings for each card, based on their orientation relative to the reader. However, these meanings aren't always used in the reading, as sometimes the cards can represent specific ideas, places, or people if the querent has a strong enough association between the two

procedure for using these is: reader shuffles, querent cuts the deck, and then four cards are dropped face down from ~10cm up to allow them to take their orientation. flip along their long edge to reveal the card. the order the cards are drawn in can have significance. 

see below for the meanings:
(the " - towards X" states the target of the card, not the orientation)

| Card                    | standard - towards the self                                                                    | inverted - towards the self                                                                       | leftward - towards someone                                                                            | rightward - towards someone else                                             |
