an item tailor-made by [[the Guild of Ghosts]] to allow for easier realm travel between their locations. not terribly rare, but can only be used by one person at a time and may only go to approved teleportation circles. 

authorization is associated with the mirror not the person, meaning if someone were to steal a mirror it would grant them access to whatever the person who owns the mirror had access to

in order to get one you need:
- to be a registered member of the Guild of Ghosts
- to have completed at least three acts of service to the guild
- be in contact of the guild for over a year

powered by a very, very small amount of both [[Drift water]] and [[Stellarium]]
