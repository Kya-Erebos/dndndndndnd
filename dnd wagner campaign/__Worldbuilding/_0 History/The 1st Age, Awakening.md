The new gods, [[Theology - characters|a pantheon of 7]], awoke unaware of anything that had happened prior to their existence. To them, all that had ever existed came about in the instant they came to consciousness. They found the inner realms, and took inspiration to build their own, helping each other pull from the Drift’s waves and constructing their [[The Realms|“outer realms”]]. 

By the time the new realms were completed, the life in the inner planes had developed quite a bit. 

The [[The Material Plane]] had entered what would be similar to our bronze age, with mastering the forge under [[Athgaar]]’s teachings and just starting to tap into the large wealth of power available in the material plane with the guidance of [[Phi]]. 

[[The Feywild]]’s inhabitants had formed a rich political environment, and developed far more powerful forms of magic, including powerful [[mage contracts|contractual bonds]]. Construction had just begun on the [[Great Central Spire]], a diplomatic centre for the fey kingdoms, and tensions between the Vampires, currently the night court of the fae, and the day court begin to blossom over a territory dispute. 

In [[The Underdark]], a large thieves guild has amassed, either driven out of the other inner realms, or those native to the realm taking advantage of the Underdark’s status as a criminal’s haven. a few schools of thought emerge, the three major ones being:
- Justifism
	- **ALL** crime is fine, so long as you can **justify** it
- criminal pacifism
	- crime is okay, so long as it is **non-violent**
- mischiefism
	- breaking laws is funny, just don't commit to the bit *too* hard

these three went on to form the major cities of the Underdark, but that happens in [[The 2nd Age, Conjuration]]

Between the gods, they split up their responsibilities and powers, leaving them to pick what they want to specialise in. This lead to some judgement, and later some hatred, between the gods, as willingly picking "war" and "trickery" seems a bit sketchy 

(we picked those because that's what the MORTALS were doing, and they clearly needed mediation - Kaff)
