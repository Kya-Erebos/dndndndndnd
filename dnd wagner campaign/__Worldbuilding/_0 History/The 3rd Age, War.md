### Hozier Time

[[Faegus Jekyl]], after amassing a larger body of followers through [[Asphodael]]'s help, had begun construction of the [[the Oasis]]. the Oasis is, on the surface, is a simple market for exotic foods. this is a front for the vast, underground HQ for the [[Church of the Blind Eye]]. it is built around a [[World Tears|World Tear]], one unknown to the rest of the world. as of now, the church was structured around Jekyl as their leader, and their primary method of communicating with Asphodael. 

so, when Jekyl died as all mortals do, the church went through a little speedbump in regards to its structure. It remained as one whole entity, but split it's teachings depending on what specific location you were at. they are: 
- *non currit ex animo* - no running from your mind
- *non currit ex praeteritum* - no running from your past
- *non currit ex futuro* - no running from your future
- *oculum pro oculo* - an eye for an eye
and so on. 

this was when the major locations formed, [[the Oasis]], [[Worlds Gate hidden Monastery]], and [[the Northern Church]]
## The Feywild
### the spire
the [[Great Central Spire]], home to the Feywild's world tear, the main place that inter-court meetings happen, and one of the very few neutral territories in the Feywild, has finally finished its construction. in light of the fiasco with the night court, the spire was very thoroughly defined to be neutral territory, bound to no individual. 

from then on it acted as both the home of the affected moon court, now becoming known as the Vampires. their true origins are forgotten to all but those present at their start, and that knowledge is not often shared as "the pain of knowing is often worse than the mystery". As their numbers grew, through love or other means, it was often believed that they were a creation of [[Phi]]'s. with approval from [[Amenodile]] and the other original vampires, history was rewritten in order for this to be the truth. 

as stated, very few people know the truth of the vampires. one notable figure is the current queen of the Night court, [[Rras]]
