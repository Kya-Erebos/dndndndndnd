## Plakos | Part 1 | Tedium
After ages of, for lack of a better term, *excruciating* boredom from being trapped away in [[Plakos]], [[Asphodael]] unable to see beyond the haphazardly strewn together walls and mismatched d√©cor, he finally saw something. 

just a flash, for less than a second, but after millennia of nothing Asphodael became obsessed over this *something*. Asphodael, with their magical perception, was able to replay this flash over and over, and they saw the worlds beyond Plakos. The endless intricacies of Mechanicus, the great halls of the Feywild, all the civilisations that had developed while he was bound by [[Drift water]]. New gods. Mortals. Immortals. Constructs. Cities. Empires. Wars. 

But what Asphodael spent the most time watching, was [[Theology - characters|the Drift]]. it had gone quiet. Complacent. Asphodael, for the first and only time, did not know why. 

and that was enough to drive the god mad.

Asphodael took their first steps since their imprisonment. And ran. And fell.
And again. 
And again. 
And again. 
For hundreds of years. 

But you can only do one thing so many times before you are forced to give up. 

Asphodael's mind returned to that flash. more specifically, the instant it had arrived. what had caused it? whatever it was had to be outside these halls, but nothing in any of the realms gave any indication of causing it.

nothing. 
but not nobody. 

[[Phi]] had caught the attention of Asphodael, mainly because of their manner of magic. this was the same that they had seen the mortals use, but Phi's was clearly far more practiced and powerful. Even with Asphodael's bonds, they had just enough mobility to mimic Phi's movements, until

the veil was pierced.

## Plakos | Part 2 | A Pierced Veil

[[the Northern Wastes]] and [[Raider's Barrens]] were relatively the same, full of nomadic peoples, caravans, and of course the Raiders. this was the case until Asphodael reached out into the mind of [[Faegus Jekyl]], a herbalist moving south from the Northern wastes to [[Avaria]]. he and his companions had been on the road for two days now, but that night they were all plagued by dreams of an odd house, with a chained person begging them for help, directing them to go East to the (yet to be created) [[the Oasis|Oasis]].

After around a week of travel, still tormented each night with dreams, they found an oasis in a small desert. 

For Faegus, and only Faegus, a voice screamed out from the oasis. 

"HELP, PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP"

and Faegus, understandably, ran in to help. 
and fell just five steps into running. 
but to him, he kept running, and his companions followed. 

at the oasis, he found a man chained to a tree, visibly starving. the man had an amulet around his neck, golden with gems set into it's face. 

"Thank the gods," he said weakly, "its been weeks since I've seen anybo-"

The man was cut off by Faegus' companions grabbing for the amulet and drawing their weapons on him and knocking Faegus out

when Faegus wakes up from the dream, he believes that his companions just killed a man in cold blood. 

---

Faegus drowned them all in the oasis. 

and in return, Asphodael gave them visions. Visions of a book, written in a language foreign to him, but one that he understood fully. Visions of a grand church, with followers bowing at his feet. But these visions weren't just hallucinations, they included instructions, loud and clear. 

"break me out."

and Faegus got to work. from the ground up, he built the Church of the Blind Eye. amassing followers and power from the shadows, tearing the north apart in order to collect resources, biding their time until they have Asphodael's [[Book of Forgotten Secrets]]

(this occurred near the turn of the next age, the [[Church of the Blind Eye]] isnt fully founded until [[The 3rd Age, War]])

## version of events for cultists

the Northern Wastes and Raider's Barrens were relatively the same, full of nomadic people, caravans, and of course the Raiders. this was the case until *something* reached out into the mind of Faegus Jekyl, a herbalist moving south from the Northern wastes to Avaria. he and his companions had been on the road for two days now, but that night they were all plagued by dreams of an oasis, with a chained person begging them for help, directing them to go East to the (yet to be named) Oasis.

After around a week of travel, still tormented each night with dreams, they found an oasis in a small desert. a voice screamed out from the oasis. 

"HELP, PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP"

Faegus and his companions, understandably, ran in to help. at the oasis, he found a man chained to a tree, visibly starving and dying. the man had an amulet around his neck, golden with gems set into it's face. 

"Thank the gods," he said weakly, "its been weeks since I've seen anybo-"

The man was cut off by Faegus' companions grabbing for the amulet and drawing their weapons on him and knocking Faegus out. when Faegus wakes up, he sees that his companions just killed a man in cold blood.

## Feywild - Tensions rising

remember that territory dispute from the last age? yeah, that escalated. a lot. guards have been stationed along the perimeter of the dispute, from both involved parties, some are rumoured to have been stationed there for a thousand years. a meeting between the current queen of the night court, [[Amenodile]], and the queen of the day court, [[Hothra]]. is scheduled in two thousand years, but for now they are both watching the other's activity closely. 

some smaller fights had broken out in the years of waiting, but all were quickly resolved by higher members of the courts. one time, [[Tau]] and [[Kaff]] appeared to break up a particularly bloody encounter, as well as court martial the three that had started the whole fight

and now, its two thousand years after this section started. a contract has been agreed to by both parties. after the signing however, something went wrong. there are two excerpts from the document you need to know:

	no party from the night court involved in the dispute is allowed into the domain of the day court without a physical permit issued by the current ruler and all her heirs. 

	should any member of either party violate any of the conditions stated in this document, said member and any blood relations shall be afflicted with the following curses:
	- the Curse of Reliance, to rely on other living beings in order to survive
	- the Curse of Permission, to rely on other living beings in order to access any premises
	- the Curse of the Shadowed, to never be able to enter the sun's light again 

during the proceedings, as is usual with territory disputes, the borders were defined in advance, and both parties sign the document on the side of the border opposite of theirs. the moment they signed the document however, Amenodile realized they had not set a start date for the effects, meaning it went into effect immediately. this caused the entire night court side of the dispute to gain the curses. 

`the Curse of Reliance` had previously been used without issue, as it was fairly well defined in another contract. however, during the proceedings, a joke was made about those affected by the curse relating them to blood-sucking leeches, which... I'm sure you can see where that plays in for the next incident. 

`the Curse of Permission` acts as expected, and is where the whole needing permission to enter thing happens. 

`the Curse of the Shadowed` was a new curse, specially made for this proceeding. rather than magically remove them from the sun as intended (in teleportation), they are slowly killed by being in the sun's light. 

the above caused the entire night court side of the dispute to become Vampires. (both in the world and by our definition)

additionally, the `blood relations` part was never fully defined anywhere, so it included ***any*** connection you could make through blood, including ingestion by either the Vampire or another being.

## Underdark - Social Renaissance 

a little bit of info on [[The Underdark]] first, the oceans of The Underdark were freshwater, so drinking water was plentiful. additionally, a large majority of the plants were edible, with few adverse effects from the ones sourced near [[Stellarium]]. 

three great cities have risen since the turn of the age: 
- [[Outlast]], the city of Justifism
- [[Solace]], the city of Criminal Pacifism
- [[Azam]], the city of Mischiefism

these cities rose greatly as a result of large numbers of creatures from other realms. 

Outlast, out of necessity to stay hidden, was established in the ocean. it started off as just a loose collection of barges, acting as hideaways and markets, but slowly grew and grew into a city on the ocean. 

Solace, which was generally well regarded for its reputation when it came to handling violent criminals, was founded near the coast that the Underdark's [[World Tears|World Tear]] was located. this meant that the majority of people entering the realm came through Solace. this lead to the city becoming the largest settlement in the Underdark. this city became a blend of standard buildings for standard jobs, a "canopy" of markets and mercenaries for hire suspended by ropes and cables, and a very literal underground market full of goods with dubious legality. 

Azam, sponsored by [[Kaff]] and [[Tau]] while he was alive, was mainly brought into existence through this patronage. a city kept aloft both through developments made by [[Avaria]] and magic provided by [[Phi]]. one main island connected to 5 smaller islands.
