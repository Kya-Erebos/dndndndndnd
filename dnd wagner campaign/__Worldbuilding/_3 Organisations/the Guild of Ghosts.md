a thieves guild with connections, agents, and lines of communication present across nearly every plane, though there are very, very few in [[Mechanicus]]

widely known in [[The Underdark]], and widely respected by three big three cities. 

one of the heads of the organisation is [[Xeron]], who also happens to be [[Mhurren]]'s criminal contact. (kinda, mechanically it's that they can find a way to contact the guild as a whole, but there is *some* relationship there)

their headquarters currently resides in [[Ether]], and is managed by Xeron, [[Erendir]], and [[Fix]]

supplies [[Ghost Mirror]]s
in order to get one you need:
- to be a registered member of the Guild of Ghosts
- to have completed at least three acts of service to the guild
- to be in contact of the guild for over a year
