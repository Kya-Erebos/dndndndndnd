## General magic info
magic tends to have a scent to it. depending on the spell the specifics can vary, but in general it has a sweet, sugary smell. 

this scent can be used by certain creatures in order to tell when magic is being used nearby, which comes in handy for things like invisibility spells and suggestion and other such things. 

in general however, only seasoned mages know how to discover the use of magic by scent alone

the "detect magic" spell heightens your perception of this scent, and causes a slightly transparent sheen over any objects or areas affected by magic. 

## Warlocks
warlocks with the same patron are incapable of targeting each other*. 

for example, if [[Ivan Riggs Clockwork|Ivan]] were to target [[Equinox]] with magic missile, the missiles would deal no damage

.* IF the patron does not want their warlocks to fight.
