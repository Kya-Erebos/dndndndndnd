much like gold sickness from lotr, this condition causes greed and violence in those that have it. 

actual fey cannot be affected by this, as they have adapted to deal with the magic that causes it, but other beings (specifically mortals) are very easily affected by it. Even just forming a contract is sometimes enough to cause temporary mania, but in order for it to be permanent fey sickness you need to have made plenty of these.
