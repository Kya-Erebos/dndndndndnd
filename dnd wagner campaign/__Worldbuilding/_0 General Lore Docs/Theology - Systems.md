## Anima
Anima are the incarnation of their domain. they have absolute power within their domain, but are rather limited over others. 

[[__Worldbuilding/_3 NPCs/Anima/the Drift|the Drift]] is part of this category, however they have absolute power over quite a few domains. while not omnipotent, they may as well be. their domain is over all of creation, so naturally they are most powerful. 

## Gods
gods, necessarily, must exist in multiple places at once. these appearances of the gods are only really impressions of them, pieces of themselves extended through the drift into the realms. they are not locked to one particular domain, and despite their immense power, their power is nothing next to anima of the same domain.
