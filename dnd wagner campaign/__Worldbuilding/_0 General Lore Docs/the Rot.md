black, fleshy organisms that shift and morph to their environment, and adversaries. 

may copy ***any*** statblock, abilities, or environmental effects to gain the advantage (excluding divine beings)

they feed on misery, on pain, on anger. they can smell it, and they. are. hungry. 

while technically sentient, they are more of a hivemind, BUT, if you isolate one on a demiplane or something they are independent
