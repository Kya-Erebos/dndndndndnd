the passage of time is measured differently in each realm. the days are always the same length, but the length, content, and even existence of seasons varies across the realms. the tables below will act as the calendars for the realms

[[The Material Plane]]'s year begins at the start of the winter, and ends at the end of autumn. there are 300 days in the year, and 30 per month

the ages span (in the material plane's calendar):
0th:  1/1/-108654/0 - 29/10/0000/0
1st:   1/1/0001/1 - 29/10/0395/1
2nd: 1/1/0396/2 - 29/10/2045/2
3rd:  1/1/2046/3 - 29/10/5026/3
4th:  1/1/5027/4 - 29/10/7086/4
5th:  1/1/7087/5 - 

meaning the world is ~115,741 years old, if we assume the start of the drift as "the start of the world"
