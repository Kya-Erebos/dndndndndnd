Member of [[the Guild of Ghosts]], but fully disappeared after their death. 

In the guild, they were previously an ambassador of the guild to both the [[Night Court]] and the [[Church of the Blind Eye]]. through those, they learned a bit in regards to [[Shatter]], worshipping them in their time at the night court, and some in regards to [[Asphodael]]

during their time in the night court, they ran into [[Pin]], who lived in the realm at the time. Pin was introduced to the idea of joining the guild. while Pin didn't at the time, they were familiar with the symbols and tools used by the guild. 

left [[Sangui]] the letter, posing the question "What is it that the gods themselves forgot?", hoping that in the event of their passing they would continue their studies into the forgotten secrets of the world.
