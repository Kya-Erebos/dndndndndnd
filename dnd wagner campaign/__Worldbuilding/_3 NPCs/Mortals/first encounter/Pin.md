a changeling escapee from [[Night Court|the Night Court]], has rather patchy knowledge about [[Theology - characters|Anima]], specifically [[Shatter]]

during their time living in the night court, they ran into [[Amikus]], who was working in the realm at the time. Pin was introduced to the idea of joining the guild. while Pin didn't at the time, they were familiar with the symbols and tools used by the guild. 

shatter doesn't want word of her existence getting out, so the night court sets out a bounty, and bounty hunters, to capture her. 

he of course, didn't want this, so he stays hidden. Keeps a low profile. wears faces that nobody would suspect. 

Their bounty had been out for around a year by the time the campaign starts, when they decide to get a more permanent job at the Great Dreams casino. The pay was decent, especially compared to their previous jobs, but this was a bit more of a high profile location. knowing this, they still choose to go on with this, wearing another's face. what could go wrong?
