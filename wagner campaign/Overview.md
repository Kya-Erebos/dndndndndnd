# what story do i want to tell?
conquering an internal evil. 
- pretty much every player character has some tie to the cult/asphodael
- every character is negatively affected by that tie (guilt, obsession, fear, etc)

additionally, through that pursuit, the world around them should grow and change positively IN THE LONG RUN. 
- removing influence from the cult over the cities/realms
- eventually killing/subduing asphodael
