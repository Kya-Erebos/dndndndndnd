## Purpose:

allude to the origins of the world, as well as The Drift abandoning Asphodael

## The Poem:
you awake alone, 
no ship nor crew, 
and early as it is, you are accident-prone. 

you start to pull from the waters, 
old trinkets riddled with dust,
but you are unhappy with what it offers. 

but keep pulling, keep working,
and the things shed their dust,
it seems you've found something worth hoarding. 

you find a friend, nearly as young as you,
although they seem to know more,
and even more, they accrue.

but as friends turn to much more,
then again far less,
keeping them around begins to feel like a chore.
