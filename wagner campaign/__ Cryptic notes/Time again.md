## Purpose:

USED
## The poem:
Back and forth and back again
counting down from 6 to 7
one step forward and you find yourself where you began
how many times until things go right?
until things go the way *they* want?

that prophet of yours seems to have something to say
that voice in your head, 
that hand drenched in a friend's blood
that sense of déjà vu of dread

the clock grows tired of its ticking
round and round and round 
back and forth and back again

follow the mask

   *\- your unseen benefactor*
