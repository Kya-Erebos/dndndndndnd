## The Poem:
Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
  
Though twisted men at their end know dark is right,  
Because their words through forked tongues held no weight they  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
  
Good men who caught and sang the sun in flight,  
And learn, too late, their wings would burn away,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
  
wild things, near death, who see with blinding sight  
Blind eyes should blaze like meteors and be fey,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
  
And you, _stardust_, there in fake heights,  
Curse me, bless me, with your fierce tears, I pray.  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
Rage, **_rage_** against the dying of the light.
