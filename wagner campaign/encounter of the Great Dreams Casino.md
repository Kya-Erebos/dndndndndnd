## Desc.
the Great Dreams Casino
- Equinox hinting at Asphodael's influence. 
- Pin begging for their life if found out
- Pin joining the party, either as themselves or as another NPC

from here, there are a few routes to take:
- if Pin is caught and believed:
	- traveling to the material plane's World Tear
	- meeting Squink!
	- hinting at Shatter through Pin's "paranoia"
	- the night court

in any case here, some lore drops will be made by Equinox connecting the party members to some *unseen benefactor* and lore drops by Elyrseas Wyvernfroth connecting him to the Church before they leave. 

additionally, have one of the Rot enter the casino, after Elyrseas and Equinox leave. combat should shift to focus on this new threat, as a "holy shit lets kill that thing before we kill each other" situation

Elyrseas Wyvernfroth leaves the realm entirely, going to the underdark city of Outlast using a stolen Ghost Mirror (stolen from Kinteppa, before they die). 
`"you see Elyrseas pull this mirror out from the bag at his side, bringing it above his head as if he is planning on smashing it against his skull, but, bringing it down to his skull, you can see that the reflection through this mirror is different than the area around you. it's a city, roughly the size of the one you're in right now, but it looks like it's storming from the brief glimse you see. after bringing the mirror down, it just keeps going, his body disapearing into the mirror until the mirror folds in on itself like,,, harry potter teleportation style. "` 

# Events

`we pick up where we left off, none of you can really see what is going on. you see the surrounding forest, though clearly illusory it is still rather annoying to navigate in. [pause] but something feels off. the sound of people around you has gone nearly silent. [pause, let ppl ask questions] the illusion falls. a lot of the people in the room  are gone now, you would assume evacuation due to the fight, but that wouldnt explain the absence of the dragonborn and the hobgoblin, and it wouldnt explain the dead silence coming from outside the casino. the only person in the room, other than you five of course, is that mage that casted the illusion. [let ppl talk, speculate, etc]`
from equinox:
`in all my time in this world, i dont believe i've been so confused as to the reason for divine intervention as powerful as this`

`i dont know how much of this you will remember, or where we end up after the jump, but it is likely that i wont remember anything. if you do end up remembering this, then please, come find me after i leave this place. *non currit ex animo*`

Grunklespurt and sloth both recognize that phrase, as it is in the blind cant. it translates to "no running from your mind"

the loop:
```
the air is... different now. it smells sweet, so sweet it burns the smell into your senses. not just smell, but taste. touch. sight. you feel wrong. you feel sick. you feel a pull in your chest before-

[ideally, cut the lights and go into complete darkness for a second]
[lights go on, act like nothing happened]

Welcome to the Material Plane. This world has seen it’s fair share of heroes and adventurers, but now the world is in a time of unprecedented peace.

This story however, is not one of heroes, nor is it one of villains. 

This story, is just that. A story. 

and that is how the people of this world have lived for a few ¿thousand years at this point? they got comfortable.

and out of everyone across all the planes, Avaria would be considered the most comfortable. it's military had been largely disbanded, keeping a few units around for the *situation* to the south of the nation. the cities, in our case Starcrest, were full of towering structures of brass and bronze, their magical airships bringing people to and from their work and homes. They were overrun with admittedly snobby individuals who, comfortable as they are, were always looking for more.

and the peak of that... *arrogant* comfort, is the Great Dreams Casino of Starcrest's recreational district, a smaller high-roller's club for the particularly wealthy, which also happens to be where we start our journey. 

it's the middle of The Material Plane's winter, two days before the day of beacons (which is like a festival thingy), one night between you and the turn of the next age, and a week before a district election, one for the very district that the casino is in. as a result, there are some very, very powerful people in the casino as I speak, along with the one member of staff, and you five, of course. 

Somebody will die tonight, maybe a few people. each of you is here for a target, and each of you have your own reasons. keep your reasons to yourself but please, let everyone else know the rest. 
```

- opening, have them introduce their characters one by one
- introduce dealer
- dealer wins game
- dealer decides to change things up, pulls out deck of [[Divination cards]]
	- `okay, this is getting...` (have a PC fill in) `I was going to say (boring/sad), but yes that too. why dont we take a break` have some magic bs happen to put the cards away and get the divination cards
	- card pulls:
		- Ferox - The Megalomaniac rightwards, The Eye leftward, The Barbarian inverted, The Fighter rightwards. **interp:** someone manipulative, obsession, Recklessness or uncontrolled aggression; impulsivity. someone in hidden conflict. `you are in pain. someone hurt either you, or someone you care deeply about, and you will stop at nothing to hurt them back. you are obsessed. likely at your expense`
		  
		- Grunklespurt - The Ghost inverted, The Fey rightwards, The Monk inverted, The Fighter inverted. **interp:** Regret or lingering attachments, loss of purpose, an unwanted influence, disconnection from yourself, consumed by battles. `this one is complicated. you *could* be haunted by some ghost of your past, a reminder of... some event. or, it could be a longing for purpose after a major loss in your past [check on how they are reacting] or, both of those. ` 
		  
		- Ivan - The Megalomaniac rightwards, The Eye leftward, The Lovers inverted, The Lovers leftward. **interp:** manipulation, obsession, one-sidedness, disharmony, dependence. `this is... rather ambiguous. let me give it a shot, someone you rely on, in your case for... power? survival? is not what they seem. they are not your friend. or something like that. `
		  
		- Sloth - The Monk inverted, The Fey inverted, The Ghost standard, The Fighter leftward. **interp:**  disconnection from yourself, illusion and deception, change, a hidden conflict. `there is something you are missing, something you have been lied to about. there will come a time when you find the truth, and it will shake you to your core. `
		  
		- Mhurren - The Cleric standard, The Fighter inverted, The Ghost standard, The Eye rightward. **interp:** healing and compassion, conflict, a source of guidance, something hidden. `this is... rather ambiguous. you are healing, and you have found guidance in that. healing from from what, i cannot tell. be wary of this guidance, there is something that isnt known to you and it will be a source of conflict for you. `
- read Ferox last, have Elyrseas enter immediately after. 
	- `from the opposite end of the room, the door *slams* open, your dealer jumping a bit and turning to see them. they are headed for the reserve lounge behind you. Ferox, you are getting a terrible sense of deja-vu. i'm sure you dont need me to introduce them, but if you'd like you can absolutely introduce them to the rest of our table.`
- Ferox goes into reserved lounge
if snoop:
	start in the middle of convo: 
```
	Marcial: no, this is absurd, i will not-
	Vex: or what? seriously, what will you do. You know what's at stake. 
	Benjamin: gods, vex, you're sure making a lot of threats, arent you?
	Vex: oh, can it tiny. you and i both know without me in power the both of you are out of business until you "clean up your act"
	Equinox: would you all get to the point, please. we have far more pressing matters to attend to. namely, what to do with this one now that they're making a name for themself. 
	Elyrseas: oh please, nobody even knows i'm here!
	Equinox: you and i both know thats not what i'm worried about. if you alert the...
	Elyrseas: the what?
	Equinox: i can feel you listening over there. show yourselves.
