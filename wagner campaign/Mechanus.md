faction of the [[Material plane]]

the first of the three factions, [[Mechanus]], is a great technological republic, combining human magics with technology. while it does not have large-scale access to materials within its own boundaries, it does have strong trade relations with the other factions, and uses its technological innovation as its main export. Recently however, tensions due to [[The Rot]] has led to isolation, fearing that it could spread through imported materials. this has led to major wealth disparity and mass recycling of materials in order to build up defences against [[The Rot]]
