-# [[Overview]]

the world is three factions and one "unclaimed" territory. 

the "unclaimed territory" is that of the raiders. they practice a form of magic taught to them by the fey long, long ago. they are neutral in nearly every conflict and facilitate trade and negotiations between the other factions. the magic they hold ***will*** be very important later, when it comes to dealing with [[The Rot]]

the first of the three factions, [[Mechanus]], is a great technological republic, combining human magics with technology. while it does not have large-scale access to materials within its own boundaries, it does have strong trade relations with the other factions, and uses its technological innovation as its main export. Recently however, tensions due to [[The Rot]] has led to isolation, fearing that it could spread through imported materials. this has led to major wealth disparity and mass recycling of materials in order to build up defences against [[The Rot]]

the second faction, [[The Monasteries]], was originally one religious organization. while echoing [[Church of the Blind Eye|the cult's]] history, it remained separate for the majority of its history. that was, until the cult's interference. then, it split into four, each taking certain, or in the fourth's case all, of the cult's teachings. 
	The first actually stuck to the old beliefs, that all are equal and all are welcome. 
	The second took some more of the oppressive beliefs, changing from "everyone is equal" to "everyone *should be* equal" or "everyone *should be* the *same*"
	The third took in some of the rituals from the cult, the rituals of devotion to it. while not necessarily part of the church, they did provide a convenient gateway to it. 
	The fourth became an extension of the cult, not really part of it but sure as hell the same. 
The Monasteries stayed peaceful with each other for nearly all of history, the only tension resulting in the fourth's "dissolvement", where in reality they slipped under the radar and exist literally underground. 

the third faction, known as "[[the Kingdom of the North]]", was originally the resource centre of the world. it relied on Mechanus to create tools and refine its resources, as well as the production of food for it's citizens. The Rot's entrance into the world originated here, in the highest point of the kingdom. while it was quickly responded to, it still slowly spread through thekingdom, and soon to the rest of the world. additionally, with Mechanus' economic isolation it has struggled to feed it's population.
